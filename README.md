Base16 stylish theme for gogs

## Caution
The current version is in a very early state. Using this version is not recommended at the moment.

Once the theme has reached a public state, it will also be available at [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/).

## Getting Started

This stylish theme is based on [base16 by chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).

### Prerequisites
* You need to have stylish installed in your browser.
* Get the firefox extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/stylish/) and the chrome one [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe).

### Installing
Since this is not official relased, you have to manual install it. It will be easier in the future.

* Open your gogs page
* stylish extension -> menu -> create theme
* give it a name, paste css and specify the url below the code

## Contributing
Please feel free submit pull requests, as I'm not a web developer at all. Please stick to the base16 color scheme.

Any help is welcome.
